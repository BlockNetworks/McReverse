   * @this {object} - Object allowing you to store state for use in onLeave.
   * @param {function} log - Call this function with a string to be presented to the user.
   * @param {array} args - Function arguments represented as an array of NativePointer objects.
   * For example use args[0].readUtf8String() if the first argument is a pointer to a C string encoded as UTF-8.
   * It is also possible to modify arguments by assigning a NativePointer object to an element of this array.
   * @param {object} state - Object allowing you to keep state across function calls.
   * Only one JavaScript function will execute at a time, so do not worry about race-conditions.
   * However, do not use this to store function arguments across onEnter/onLeave, but instead
   * use "this" which is an object for keeping state local to an invocation.
